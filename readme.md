###Welcome to the ML256 Lundum Dare 30 Project


We are entering a mobile web game to the Ludum Dare #30 game creation competition.


### Game Outline

You are a character in command of a square-based domain. Unfortunately, the edges are enforced, and you are limited in area and resources to create your kingdom. In order to gain more living space, you (the person) must 'interact' with others, and swap QR codes to share each others domain. Once doing this, you will recieve an extra domain's worth of land to conquer and construct. The more players you meet in real life and domain-swap with, the more elaborate a construct you may design.

Good luck.


### To Run

For now, simply aquire the working directory (this git) and open game.html in a javascript-capable browser.


### Known issues

* Loading from storage kind of sucks. You have to reset your game to get items to exist again, after you reload the browser.
